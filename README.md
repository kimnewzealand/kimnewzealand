I have recently been learning about AI tooling and Agents:

- Initial repo learning about the [basics of Agents and related libaries](https://github.com/kimnewzealand/agent-tutorial)
- Then a repo learning about a vector based [Simple RAG](https://github.com/kimnewzealand/rag-tutorial) using a generic use case to pull information from IT compliance documentation to take action on compliance obligations
- Currently working on a [Graph RAG](https://github.com/kimnewzealand/graphrag-tutorial)

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ See my data visualisation project using D3, [Celestial Maps](https://observablehq.com/@kimnewzealand/celestial-maps) and talk called [Connecting the Stars](https://connected-stars.netlify.app/)
- See some of my other talks [Art of Maps](artofmaps.netlify.app/) and [Art of Maps Episode 2](artofmaps2.netlify.app/)

I have recently been learning about AI tooling and Agents:

- Initial repo learning about the [basics of Agents and related libaries](https://github.com/kimnewzealand/agent-tutorial)
- Then a repo learning about a vector based [RAG Agent](https://github.com/kimnewzealand/rag-tutorial) using a simple use case to pull information from IT compliance documentation
- Currently working on a [Graph RAG](https://github.com/kimnewzealand/graphrag-tutorial)
